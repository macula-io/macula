## Key Questions Answered

### What is Macula?

Infrastructure for building **decentralized applications** - systems where nodes discover each other, share services, and collaborate directly without centralized cloud dependency.

### Why does it matter?

- **Cost control**: Predictable infrastructure costs vs. unpredictable cloud bills
- **Data sovereignty**: Data stays where it's created
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure
- **Latency**: Local-first means milliseconds, not hundreds of milliseconds
- **Independence**: No vendor lock-in

### Who is it for?

- **IoT/Edge deployments** - Smart homes, industrial automation, sensor networks
- **Multi-party networks** - Supply chains, partner ecosystems, consortiums
- **Privacy-sensitive applications** - Healthcare, finance, government
- **Offline-capable systems** - Remote sites, mobile deployments

### What makes it different?

- Built on **HTTP/3 (QUIC)** - works through NAT/firewalls
- **BEAM foundation** - 35 years of distributed systems engineering
- **Self-organizing** - nodes discover each other automatically
- **Multi-tenant** - isolation between realms by design
